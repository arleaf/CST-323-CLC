This is a simple web application built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and using Maven dependencies.  
It will follow the MVC design.  MySQL will be used as the database running on MAMP for this first part of the assignment.  
The goal of this application is to learn how to deploy an application onto cloud servers while collaborating.
